Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a complete database system** using the MySQL database management system (DBMS).  
The database was developed based on a **textual description of requirements**, translated into a structured and optimized data model.

The project includes:
- Conceptual and logical **database design**  
- Implementation of **tables, relationships, and constraints**  
- Creation of **stored procedures** and **triggers** to automate database operations  
- **Data import and indexing** for performance optimization  
- Validation of data integrity and consistency  

The final system represents a **functional, scalable, and maintainable** database solution.

Features
- **Requirements-based design:** Built from a detailed textual description of system needs.  
- **Normalization:** Logical schema designed to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.  
- **Automation:** Stored procedures and triggers to handle conditional logic automatically.  
- **Efficient data import and indexing:** Uses bulk loading and indexing techniques for better performance.
